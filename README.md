# Da Times
-------
### Overview

Da Times is the final deliverable of Turing's Mod 4 inning. This project was completed in 8 hours and was supposed to mock a take home assessment that would be given as part of an interview in the real world. The expectation for this project was to consume the [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/overview) in order to display the articles' headlines as well as a detailed view of each article. Additionally, other expectations were to have a filtering functionality as well as responsive design. 

This was a solo [project](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_fe) and is built using React, React Router, JavaScript, and CSS. This project was meant to display ability of wrting clean code to solve a problem with an understanding of basic UX. Nothin' too fancy.


- The user can visit the home page to view all the articles at once 
- The user can also use the dropdown menu and select a specific section which will display all articles of that section
- The user can select an article which will take them to a new page that displays the articles's details
- At any time, the user can click the page title to return to the homepage
